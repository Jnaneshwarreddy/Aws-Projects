step 1: create Godaddy account and purchase a simple domain for ex: testing24.xyz
step 2: go to my product and choose ur domain and change the name server which is created by hosting zones in route 53 resource
step 3: after setting up nameserver in AWS launch ec2 instance and route 53 while hosting a zone mention the ipaddress of ec2 instance(public ip ) in the description.
step 4: sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install nginx -y (install nginx and update system)
step 5: sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx (install Certbot and its Nginx plugin which can be used to secure Nginx with Check that the Nginx configuration file has a server_name directive that matches the domain you want to secure)
step 6:  sudo mkdir -p /var/www/testing24.xyz/html (make directory including parent directory that doesn't exist and it will prevent the errors)
step 7: chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/testing24.xyz/html (changing ownership of file or directory)
step 8: sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/testing24.xyz (assign the file permission)
step 9: vim /var/www/testing24.xyz/html/index.html (to include some html source )
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to testing24.xyz.in!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success! The testing24.xyz.in server block is working!</h1>
    </body>
</html>

step 10 : sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/testing24.co.xyz (setting up nginx server)
 server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        root /var/www/testing24.xyz/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
        server_name testing24.xyz www.testing24.xyz;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

step 11: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/testing24.xyz /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ (make the sites directory enable of nginx)
step 12: sudo nginx -t (testing the nginx server) you will get successful
atep 13: sudo systemctl restart nginx (restart the nginx )
step 14: sudo certbot certonly \
  --agree-tos \ (Agree to the Let's Encrypt terms of service) 
  --email jnaneshwar.jnanibalu@gmail.com \ (Provide an email address for the certificate owner contact and renewal notices.)
  --manual \ (Perform a manual DNS challenge, where you'll need to create a TXT record in your domain's DNS settings.)
  --preferred-challenges=dns \ (Choose the DNS challenge as the preferred authentication method.)
  -d *.testing24.xyz \ (Specify the domain names for which the certificate should be obtained.)
  --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory (setup cerbot with ssl certificate to encrypt nginx and directory encryption)
step 15 : make the entry of dns txt in dns records of aws
step 16:   certbot --nginx (FOR HTTP TO HTTPS FORWARDING RUN THE BELOW COMMAND )
