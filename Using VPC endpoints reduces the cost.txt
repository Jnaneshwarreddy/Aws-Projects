Using VPC endpoints reduces the cost of our infrastructure for private subnet instances

cause : when we use the NAT cloud provider will cost us some $/hr and also transmission cost if we are using other services like s3 bucket so to avoid this we use the concept called vpc endpoints. 
 
lets make project which uses the endpoints to reduce costing

step1 : create vpc including  1 public subnet & 1 private subnet

step 2: launch ec2-instances like 1st instance in public-subnet and 2nd in private-subnet(without public ip address)

step 3: for 2nd instance we cant connect without public ip so to connect this instance we use 1st instance as a jump server and using private ip we will be loged in 2nd            
        instance 

step 4: now our two instances are up now & try to access s3 bucket from 1st instance and we successfully download the bucket but from 2nd instance we cant able to         
        download s3 bucket
step 5: to solve this problem we create NAT for public subnet and then we will be able to download the s3 bucket 

 but in the above project excercise we have used the NAT for accessing s3 bucket but this will increase our infra cost and to reduce we have to create endpoints 


step 1: create endpoint (gateway endpoint) please note that attach the private subnet to it & select s3 as service

step 2 : restart 2 nd instance, tried to access s3 from private instance & successfully downloaded s3 bucket.
